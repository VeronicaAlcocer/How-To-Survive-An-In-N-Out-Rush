			<h3>FINDING YOUR SEAT</h3>
				<p>
				If you find a Leaving Customer ally, it's your lucky day. Don't expect this to happen every time, so 
				make sure your Seat Stealer is actively searching otherwise. Once you find a table, make sure there are always people sitting. The only person who should be up is your Condiment Companion. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Remember to check for outdoor seating if the weather is decent! If there is truly nothing available and all your fellow customers are acting like savages, just get your order to go. Eating on your comfy couch at home, or even in your car, is far superior than attempting to stare down strangers to give up their seats because let's be real, most of us are not that intimidating. Pray to the fast food gods that you manage to get a booth before you go.

			<h3 >WAYS TO ENTERTAIN YOURSELF</h3>
				<p style="padding-right: 3em;">
				Alright, so by now you have found a parking spot, ordered your food, got a table, and your little
				ketchup cups are waiting to marry your fries. Life is good, but maybe you're bored. If you have company, simply having a conversation shoud keep you entertained. But who knows, maybe you're on an
				awkward date or brain-dead because this outing is a pit stop on a several hour long road trip. We don't know your life, and we won't try to judge. Here's some options to consider meanwhile:

				<ol>
					<li>Get stickers and an In-N-Out hat from an employee</li>
					<li>Draw art on napkins</li>
					<li>Make caterpillars out of the straw wrappers</li>
					<li>Play that hand slap game until the other cries mercy</li>
					<li>Play a game of hangman</li>
					<li>Try to steal something from the person sitting across from you</li>
					<li>People watch the other customers</li>
					<li>Recreate a diner scene from any movie or TV show you enjoy</li>
					<li>Sing a showtune</li>
					<li>Reveal your darkest secrets</li>
					
				</ol>
