			<p>We've all been there. The evening rolls around and you're starving for some comfort food. You're not in the position of cooking or paying for an expensive meal, so the go-to craving is In-n-Out. However, much to your dismay, the moment you step foot through those doors you immediately regret your decision. Because half the f*cking world decided they wanted In-n-Out too. But you're too hungry and desperate, so you're stuck here. This is the only source you'll need to ensure you make it out alive.
