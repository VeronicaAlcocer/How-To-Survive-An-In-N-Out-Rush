					<div class="flex-child" style="padding-left: 1em">Those In-N-Out employees are so nice and energetic and are just trying to do their best. Aren't you impressed when they read back your order at super sonic speed? And they almost never mess up. If you need something reasonable, and ask them politely, you will most likely get what you want. This also follows along our conduct code of how to treat employees under our Ordering page.

Once again, if you're kind and polite when asking for something reasonable like, "Hey, can we use your table whenever you're done using it please?", you will most likely get a yes. Wouldn't you rather guarantee a seat than search for hours and hours? Okay, maybe not hours but it's still a drag to look for a while.
