					<div class="flex-child" style="padding-left: 1em">We've all been around those. The one with the asymmetrical bob that wants speak to a manager because she was denied using a coupon that expired a year ago. She has no manners yet expects 1st class treatment from everyone. She'll probably have a couple 
					annoying kids with her who have no concept of personal space. Fingers crossed she's not taking half 
					the soccer team in her minivan.

There's bound to be someone that's acting like a complete jackass when driving. This species has no problem shouting profanity at other drivers, honking their horn, and basically lacking an ounce of patience or compassion. Hopefully you only see them on your way out of the place and not inside the restaurant.

					<div class="flex-child" style="padding-left: 1em">These people just want to watch the world burn. Okay, maybe not, but they're just rude. They will try to cut in line. Um, RUDE. Don't put up with this. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts. First come, first serve. Use whatever childhood rhyme you wish to bring logic to this world. Stand your ground, but don't get in a fist fight over it. They are just burgers.
