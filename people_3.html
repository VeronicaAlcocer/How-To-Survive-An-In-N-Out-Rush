					<div class="flex-child" style="padding-left: 1em">This person will be very useful to have with you if the parking lot is a nightmare. Be sure to read our Transportation page to remind you of their importance. Having a competent driver and parker will determine most of your experience at In-N-Out. Do not take the role lightly.

Alliterations are just more fun to use. If the restaurant is packed, you want someone to keep an eye out for a spot. Be smart and look for open tables while you're waiting in line. The Seat Stealer can check out all areas in time, and can decide whether or not you'll have to take your order to go. This role can be combined with designated parker if you're short on people.

					<div class="flex-child" style="padding-left: 1em">Once you find a place to sit, don't have everyone getting up for every single item needed. Assign a designated person that grabs the extra napkins, ketchup, salt and whatever else your heart desires. This will also prevent unnecessary crowds forming around the different stations. This person could also grab everyone's orders from the pick up station. Just make sure you're thinking this all through.
