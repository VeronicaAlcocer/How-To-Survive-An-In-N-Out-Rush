			<h3>YOUR RIDE MATTERS</h3>
				<p>
				It does. Do not take a Hummer to this type of outing. If you own a Hummer, you should probably
				re-evaluate your life choices. If there's a rush, that means the parking lot is also a war zone. 
				</p>
				<p>
				You should be driving some type of four door that fits into the compact spots. This will seat everyone 
				who may accompany you on your fast food run. The less fancy, the better too. Do you really want to 
				take home your greasy, leftover fries and millkshake in a Tesla? You do you though. 
				</p>

				<h3 style="padding-top: 3.5em;">THE CAR YOU'LL WANT</h3>
				<p >
				The pictures on the right are examples of what we thought was a great option for a car to drive. It'll get you where you need to go,
				and it's small enough to park in most spots. You'll be able to weasel in and out (ha, get it) of the 
				parking lot like a pro. 
				</p>
				<p>
				While we're on the subject of driving, it's important to bring up the role of your designated parker. 
				You need to be as efficient as possible. If you're surving an In-N-Out rush, that means the parking lot 
				is a guaranteed nightmare. Not only are people trying to leave and arrive, there's the deadly drive-thru line
				that's blocking traffic. 
				</p>
				<p>
				If you are not able to find a spot yet within 5 minutes, all the passengers must evacuate the 		vehicle and get inside. You're wasting precious time when you could be getting a spot in line and 
				finding a table. What are you waiting for? Get going!
				</p>
