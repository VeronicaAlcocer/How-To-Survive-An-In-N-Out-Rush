			<h3>Shoes</h3>
			<p>
				A subject not to tread lightly. *bum dum tss* But for real. Don't wear heels. Don't wear new, stiff boots you're still breaking in. You need reliable tennis shoes of some kind. Not only will you be comfortable standing in line, but you can f*cking book it once you receive your delicious food.

				Keep it simple. No fuss. Yes, you want to look nice, but this isn't 
				a designer fashion show. You are here to EAT. So dress like it. 
				You are in a greasy, salty, condiment-hazard zone.

			<h3>Outerwear</h3>
			<p>
				If you think you have enough pockets - wrong. You need more. You will always need more. If it's too hot of a day then rely more on a different article of clothing with pockets, or a friend with a purse. You need to be prepared to quickly stick whatever you may need in these pockets (napkins, straws, condiments, receipts). If you also decide to bring our suggested tools, it's essential to have a convenient stow away place on you. We recommend a classic sweatshirt of some sort. If you're willing to invest, try a safari jacket or even an over-the-door shoe rack fashioned like a cape. I promise, no one will be staring too much.

			<h3>Bottoms</h3>
			<p>
				The same rules apply with simplicity. Mobility is the upmost importance though, so if you're top heavy with your top layers, opt for some leggings or sweatpants. You will regret wearing those tight skinny jeans with no stretch *shudders*. We won't hate on all the jeans though. If it's too hot, athletic shorts are a solid option. Be sure to wear dark colors, who the hell wants to accidentally sit in ketchup while wearing white shorts??

			<h3>Watch</h3>
			<p>
				If you don't have a portable charger, and you're terrible at rationing your phone battery
				charge, you should wear a watch. If your phone dies on you, you will be trapped in a vortex. 
				Is it 8:00? 10:00? Who knows? You don't have the time. Because you were too cavalier and thought 
				there would be no consequences to playing Candy Crush while having your Wi-Fi and bluetooth on, 
				and 10 other apps open. You fool. Wear a damn watch.

			<h3>Hat</h3>
			<p>
				You may not need this, but we're just being a mom here and making sure you don't get too cold. 
				Beanies are comfy and snuggly, so why not wear one? This is the fashion page after all.

			<h3>Portable Charger:</h3>
			<p>
				You may not need this, but you may use up more of your phone battery than you realize.
				Think about it, you're probably going to scroll on 5 different apps while in line and
				at your table. Maybe you still play Candy Crush or you listen to a podcast or a 90's 
				hip hop playlist. Just be prepared.  -->
