			<h3>PREPARING YOUR ORDERS</h3>
				<p>
				In-N-Out's menu is straightforward. You probably already know exactly what to order. Incase you 
				have never eaten there, you can look at this menu. And yes, it includes their "secret" menu. But if you're arriving during a rush, you will have plenty of time to decide.</p>

				<div class="order">
					<a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/menu.aspx" target="_blank" class="order">In-N-Out Menu</a>
				</div>
			
				<p>
				Here's what is important to take away: you might reach the front of the line while your driver is still trying to find a parking spot, and another friend is trying to find seats. So you need to know their orders so you 
				don't hold up the line. Don't be that incompetent person who still doesn't know what to order after spending
				all that time in line. Customers are hangry, employees are tired, and if you read the People section of this website, you know the risks. 
				</p>

			<h3>HOW TO TREAT EMPLOYEES</h3>
				<p>
				You'd think we wouldn't have to explain this to anyone past the age of 9, but surprise! People are horrible.
				We want to make sure you have manners. Have you witnessed customer meltdown in a restaurant? Not pretty. So, here are some things to keep in mind: 
				</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li style="height:2em">Say "please" and "thank you"</li>
					<li style="height:2em">Make eye contact with them</li>
					<li style="height:3.5em">Enunciate your words, it's probably crowded and loud and they won't hear your mumbling</li>
					<li style="height:2em">Do not yell at them</li>
					<li style="height:3.5em">Do not throw a fit if something on a menu is unavailable</li>
					<li style="height:3.5em">Do not blame them for any misfortune out of their control</li>
					<li style="height:3.5em">Do not complain about the line or wait. They know it's busy, they're the ones on the clock</li>
					<li style="height:2em">Have your cash or card ready in hand</li>
					<li style="height:3em">Just be f*cking nice. Do you know how exhausting their shifts must be? They don't need your bullsh*t</li>

				</ul>
				</p>
