			<h3>Why, hello there</h3>
			<p>
			I'm Veronica. I created this website because it was an assigned project. My class was
			told to code a "Survial Guide" of some kind, while meeting some criteria. I decided to 
			create the most millennial Californian concept I could think of: a website dedicated to our beloved
			fast food chain. I hope browsing this site made you laugh a little. If you thought it was super 
			corny or cheesy, I will be flattered. This website was not meant to be taken seriously.
			</p>

			<p>
			If you want to know a little more about me, I am a student at Academy of Art University. I'm 
			earning a BFA in Advertising, and hope to work in an agency as a copywriter after graduating. I also 
			love corgis! It's what I wrote about for my very first HTML assignment.

			<h3>Honorable mention</h3>
			<p>
			This is my friend and classmate, Diangelo Cuevas, who helped me shoot content! I am very grateful for him 
			putting up with my shenanigans. Not many would agree to drive a friend around and model in a fast food parking lot for free. Fun fact: Diangelo wore sweatpants over his jeans while we were filming. He continued to wear two layers of pants for the rest of the evening. That's commitment right there.
